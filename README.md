Hello
My name is Mahda Kazemian. I'm the the OOSD program student at SAIT.
This is my final assignment regarding design a web page useing
html, css,and java script. In this project there are lots of html commands 
in order to creat a web page with some paragraphs,pictures,and form,the 
commands to style them in css ,and finaly various java script functions to do 
specefic things in our website such as ( creating a table,click and focus functions,
eventprevent,submit,reset, addlistener,settimeout,and etc). I belive it can be a good 
example for begginer students who want to start to design a website. At the end, I would 
like to thank to my kind,patient, and wonderful instructor Heather Tovey who guided me 
during my project and I learned many things from her during my course.
